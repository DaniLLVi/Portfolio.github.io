        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Daniella, a passionate Filipina student on a journey to become a skilled software engineer. Currently delving into the realms of HTML, CSS, and Python - I'm eager to advance my coding skills and embark on a fulfilling career in the tech industry.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm thrilled to be on the path of self-learning, constantly exploring new concepts and expanding my knowledge. In the pursuit of academic excellence, I'm set to kickstart my educational journey at Bellevue College, working towards earning my AA and laying a solid foundation for my future endeavors.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Beyond coding, I have four cats with my partner and I love video games. They all have their own personalities and it's never a boring day with them! As for video games, I have always loved them since I was a kid. I find joy in the immersive worlds and problem-solving challengers they offerâ€”a perfect complement to my passion for coding.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Currently, on my portfolio, I'm actively working on improving it's responsiveness, design, and implementing more features.</p>
